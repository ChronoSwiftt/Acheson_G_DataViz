				<p class="indented">The Canada versus United States rivalry has gone on for a very long time in both the entire Olympic Games and Hockey in itself and has amounted to some awesome competition with Canada coming out on top in most matchups. The Graphs show in a mirrored fashion that most of the teams are very similar in results with the Canadian mens team being an exception and winning Gold almost every year. As for the other teams the Womens Hockey Game is ruled by different teams but in recent years the Canadian Women have won in convincing fashion. The graphs being all around even with a bit over 30% in each medal category says that previous success doesn't mean alot in the Olympics because it changes every year. Overall of the sports in the Olympics even though Canada and the United States usually dominate most Winter medal counts but they are overall have a even average of above 30 percent  which means that even though the US has more medals as of 2014 that will not always be the naritive forever.</p>
